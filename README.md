# LeetCode-DSA-Practice

## About
This repo contains the code I have done to all the questions on LeetCode that I have attempted. I am currently using Python as I am strongest in it and might learn to solve using C in the future. 

## Code Documentation
Python files are named in the following format: 
(AlgoMap Prob No.)_ (LeetCode Problem No.)_(Problem Name).py

Within each Python file contains its run-time and memory usage with its stats.
